ObjectUserList

This defines an extensible object that can be used
to maintain a list of users and some interesting
info about them - nothing too cloak-n-dagger - just
stuff like login time, recent tipping history, etc.


Features:

-   Definable delay before a user is "re-added" to the
    the list.  Quite handy if a user is having trouble
    staying connected or is otherwise frequently leaving
    and re-entering the room.
-   Predefined methods for tallying tips and chat messages.
-   Easily add programmer defined properties via prototype
-   Sortable by any property/field.
